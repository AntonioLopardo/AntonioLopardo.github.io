I'm a machine learning engineer at [Veezoo](https://veezoo.com/) working on LLM-based natural language to SQL translation.
I studied at ETH ZÃ¼rich for my master's and have BSc from Politecnico di Milano.

I've woked on LLM fine-tuning, human-in-the-loop evaluation systems, and efficient vector search methods. During my studies I also explored medical question-answering with RAG, program synthesis for mathematical reasoning, and knowledge graph embeddings.

Outside of work, my current research interests are in representation learning, but I spend most of my time training for triathlons, and complaining about not having time for anything else.ðŸ™ƒ
