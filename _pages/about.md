I’m a machine learning engineer with a Master’s in Computer Science from ETH Zürich and a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. I’ve worked on projects involving approximate nearest neighbor search, program synthesis, knowledge graph embeddings, and privacy-preserving NLP. My major research interest is representation learning.
