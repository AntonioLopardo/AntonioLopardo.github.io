      "summary": "Transformer-based LLMs have shown incredible generative capabilities, producing text and even conducting dialogue significantly better than any previous architecture. One area in which they still struggle in is math. We tested whether recent open sourced LLMs trained to generate code might be useful for math word problems by bypassing arithmetic operations all together and sticking to producing Python programs that perform the operations when run.",

Unlike other open domain QA systems, that encode all their knowledge in their parameters, RAG leans on a textual knowledge base, like Wikipedia, to retrieve relevant information to answer questions. We finetuned RAG components to work better on the medical domain and developed a textual knowledge base of our own.",

A Bayesian version of SVD proved the most effective, but we also implemented Graph Convolutional Networks and other algorithms for matrix factorization and reconstruction.",

To detect the motion of multiple people in a scene, we added a form of teacher-forcing and more channel dropout to the state-of-the-art neural architecture for the task (RAFT) and then trained it on synthetic data we generated.",
